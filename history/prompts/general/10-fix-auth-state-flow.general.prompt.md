# Fix Authentication State Flow with Three-State System

## PROMPT_TEXT
Fix the authentication and redirect flow permanently by implementing an authState with three values: "unknown", "authenticated", "unauthenticated". Ensure proper redirect logic and prevent redirect loops.

## RESPONSE_TEXT
Implemented a three-state authentication system with proper redirect flow:

1. AuthProvider now uses authState with "unknown", "authenticated", "unauthenticated" values
2. Network errors are not treated as unauthenticated, only 401 responses
3. Dashboard page redirects only when authState is "unauthenticated"
4. Login page redirects to dashboard only when authState is "authenticated"
5. Both pages show loader while authState is "unknown"
6. All fetch requests properly use credentials: "include"
7. Proper loading state management prevents premature redirects

## OUTCOME
Authentication flow now works correctly without redirect loops. Users stay on dashboard after login and page refreshes maintain auth state.

## EVALUATION
The solution permanently fixes the redirect loop by implementing a proper three-state authentication system that distinguishes between loading, authenticated, and unauthenticated states.
