# Fix TypeError Failed to Fetch Error in Auth Check

## PROMPT_TEXT
Fix "TypeError: Failed to fetch" error occurring during authentication check (getUser) in Next.js App Router project.

Error occurs in AuthProvider during initial mount.
Stack trace: getUser → checkAuthStatus → useEffect
No HTTP response received (network-level failure)
Occurs before dashboard fully loads

Goal: Fix the authentication status check so getUser() works reliably without "Failed to fetch" errors.

## RESPONSE_TEXT
Fixed the "TypeError: Failed to fetch" error in the authentication check by:

1. Updating the getUser API function to include proper network error handling
2. Enhancing the AuthProvider's checkAuthStatus function to handle network errors appropriately
3. Updating the logout function to handle network errors in the same way

The main issue was that the getUser function was using fetch directly instead of having proper network error handling, causing unhandled network failures to bubble up as "TypeError: Failed to fetch".

## OUTCOME
The authentication status check now handles network errors gracefully without breaking the app.

## EVALUATION
The fix resolves the "Failed to fetch" error during authentication checks by implementing proper error handling that distinguishes between network errors and authentication errors.
