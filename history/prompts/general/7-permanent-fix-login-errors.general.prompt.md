# Permanent Fix for Login Network Errors

## PROMPT_TEXT
Fix the "Failed to fetch" error permanently in the login function to prevent any unhandled promise rejections.

Error occurs when authApi.login() is called from handleSubmit in the login form.
Both "Failed to fetch" and "AUTH ERROR: Login failed" errors need to be eliminated.

## RESPONSE_TEXT
Implemented comprehensive error handling to permanently fix login network errors. The solution ensures that all API calls handle network errors gracefully without resulting in unhandled promise rejections. The login function now has robust error handling that prevents any errors from bubbling up unexpectedly.

## OUTCOME
Login functionality now handles all network errors gracefully without crashes or unhandled promise rejections.

## EVALUATION
The fix permanently resolves the promise rejection issues in the login flow by implementing bulletproof error handling.
