# Fix Broken Edit Todo Functionality

## PROMPT_TEXT
Fix broken "Edit Todo" functionality in Next.js Dashboard (App Router).

Problem: Editing an existing task does NOT work correctly
- Either edit modal opens but data doesn't update
- Or input doesn't prefill
- Or API is called but UI doesn't update
- Or nothing happens on save

Goal: Make the Edit Todo feature fully functional, reliable, and production-ready.

## RESPONSE_TEXT
Fixed the broken "Edit Todo" functionality by addressing a schema mismatch between frontend and backend.

Root Cause: The frontend was sending a `status` field that the backend didn't accept, causing the edit functionality to appear broken.

Solution: Updated the backend Todo model to include the `status` field and enhanced the service logic to maintain consistency between `completed` and `status` fields.

Changes made:
1. Added `TodoStatus` enum to models
2. Extended Todo, TodoUpdate, TodoPatch, and TodoCreate models to include status field
3. Updated TodoService to handle status/completed consistency
4. Updated test data to include status field

## OUTCOME
The edit functionality now works correctly with proper schema alignment between frontend and backend.

## EVALUATION
The fix resolves the edit functionality issue by ensuring both frontend and backend use compatible schemas. The implementation maintains consistency between the `completed` boolean and `status` string fields.
