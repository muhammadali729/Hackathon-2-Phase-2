## Prompt

Permanently fix the authentication and redirect flow by implementing an authState with three values: "unknown", "authenticated", "unauthenticated". Ensure proper redirect logic, loading states, and prevent redirect loops. Fix all authentication and network errors in Next.js + FastAPI Todo application. Specifically address: TypeError: Failed to fetch, Network error: Unable to connect to the server, AUTH ERROR: Login failed, getUser() and login() failing inside AuthProvider. The login → dashboard flow must work properly with proper auth state management and loading handling.

## Response snapshot

Implemented a comprehensive three-state authentication system with proper redirect flow and error handling:

1. AuthProvider now uses authState with "unknown", "authenticated", "unauthenticated" values
2. Added isLoading state for proper loading management
3. Network errors are properly handled separately from auth errors (only 401 responses indicate unauthenticated state)
4. Dashboard page redirects only when authState is "unauthenticated" (after loading completes)
5. Login page redirects to dashboard only when authState is "authenticated" (after loading completes)
6. Both pages show loader while authState is "unknown" or isLoading is true
7. All fetch requests properly use credentials: "include" for cookie authentication
8. Proper loading state management prevents premature redirects during auth state determination
9. Created dedicated Loader component for consistent loading experiences
10. Fixed CORS configuration to properly support credentials
11. Enhanced error handling to differentiate between network failures and authentication errors

The solution addresses the root cause of redirect loops by ensuring that redirects only occur after the authentication state is fully determined, not during the loading phase. Network errors no longer cause incorrect authentication state changes.

## Outcome

Authentication flow now works correctly without redirect loops. Users stay on dashboard after login, page refreshes maintain auth state, and network errors are properly handled without causing incorrect redirects. The implementation follows production-ready patterns with proper error boundaries and clear user feedback.

✅ No redirect loops - Users remain on dashboard after successful login
✅ Dashboard stays visible after login - Proper auth state management
✅ Proper auth state maintained after refresh - Three-state system persists state
✅ Network errors don't cause logout or redirects - Proper error handling

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Previously, the redirect loop occurred because redirects happened during loading states when auth status wasn't fully determined
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): All authentication flows now pass without redirect loops
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Combined multiple authentication fixes into single comprehensive solution
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Monitor for edge cases in production and add more granular error reporting if needed
