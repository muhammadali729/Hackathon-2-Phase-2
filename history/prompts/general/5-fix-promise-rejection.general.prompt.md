# Fix Unhandled Promise Rejection in Auth Check

## PROMPT_TEXT
Fix the "Failed to fetch" error that's causing unhandled promise rejections in the AuthProvider during initial mount.

Error occurs when getUser() is called from checkAuthStatus() in AuthProvider.useEffect
The error is an unhandled promise rejection leading to app crash

## RESPONSE_TEXT
Fixed the unhandled promise rejection by improving the error handling in the getUser function. The function now catches all errors (including network errors) and returns null instead of throwing, preventing unhandled promise rejections. The AuthContext was also simplified to not need additional error handling since the API function handles it internally.

## OUTCOME
The "Failed to fetch" error no longer causes unhandled promise rejections and the app doesn't crash during auth initialization.

## EVALUATION
The fix resolves the promise rejection issue by ensuring all errors are properly handled within the API function itself.
