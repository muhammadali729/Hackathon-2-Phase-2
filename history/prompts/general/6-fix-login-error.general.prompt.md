# Fix Login Function Network Error Handling

## PROMPT_TEXT
Fix the "Failed to fetch" error that's occurring in the login function when called from the login page handleSubmit function.

Error occurs when authApi.login() is called from handleSubmit in the login form.
The error is an unhandled promise rejection during login API call.

## RESPONSE_TEXT
Fixed the login function error handling to ensure all network errors are properly caught and handled. The login function now has robust error handling for both network errors and API errors, preventing unhandled promise rejections that were causing the app to crash during login attempts.

## OUTCOME
The login form now handles network errors gracefully without crashing the application.

## EVALUATION
The fix resolves the promise rejection issue in the login function by ensuring all error paths are properly handled.
