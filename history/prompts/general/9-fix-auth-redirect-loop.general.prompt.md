# Fix Authentication Redirect Loop

## PROMPT_TEXT
Fix authentication redirect loop after successful login. User logs in successfully, backend sets HTTP-only auth cookie correctly, but app immediately redirects back to /login. Auth works but auth state management is broken.

## RESPONSE_TEXT
Fixed the authentication redirect loop by implementing proper auth state management:

1. Added isLoading state to AuthContext to distinguish between loading/authenticated states
2. Updated dashboard page to wait for auth loading to complete before checking authentication
3. Updated login page to wait for auth loading before redirecting
4. Properly guarded redirect logic that only executes after auth state is determined

The fixes ensure that redirects only happen after the authentication state is fully determined, preventing premature redirects during the loading phase.

## OUTCOME
Authentication flow now works correctly without redirect loops. Users stay on dashboard after login and page refreshes maintain auth state.

## EVALUATION
The solution permanently fixes the redirect loop by properly managing authentication loading states and preventing redirects during the loading phase.
