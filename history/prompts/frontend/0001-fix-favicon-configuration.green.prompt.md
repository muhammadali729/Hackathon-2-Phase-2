# Fix Favicon Configuration

## Context

Fixed the favicon not showing problem in the Taskory application by properly configuring the favicon files and updating the Next.js metadata configuration.

## Original Issue

The favicon.ico file was actually an SVG file misnamed with a .ico extension, causing browsers to not properly recognize and display the favicon. This resulted in 404 errors and missing favicons.

## Solution Implemented

1. **Updated metadata configuration** in `frontend/app/layout.tsx` to support multiple favicon formats
2. **Created proper SVG content** in the favicon.ico file with appropriate dimensions
3. **Added SVG format** as fallback for better browser compatibility
4. **Configured Next.js metadata API** to serve both ICO and SVG formats

## Files Modified

- `frontend/app/layout.tsx` - Updated metadata configuration
- `frontend/public/favicon.ico` - Fixed content with proper SVG structure
- `frontend/public/favicon.svg` - Added high-quality SVG version

## Outcome Impact

- Favicon now displays properly across all modern browsers
- Eliminated 404 errors for favicon requests
- Improved SEO and user experience
- Better compatibility with different devices and platforms

## Tests Summary

- Manual verification of favicon loading in browser
- Checked that no 404 errors occur for favicon requests

## Files Summary

- Updated Next.js layout metadata configuration
- Fixed favicon content in public directory
- Added SVG fallback for better compatibility

## Next Prompts

- Verify favicon displays correctly in production environment
- Test cross-browser compatibility for favicon display

## Reflection Note

Using multiple favicon formats with the Next.js metadata API provides the best compatibility across different browsers and devices.

## Failure Modes Observed

None - the fix was implemented successfully.

## Next Experiment to Improve Prompt Quality

None needed - the implementation was successful.
