  now your wrok to fix this issue when we login succesful to gowing to dashboard but we return to login page so fix it
response_text: |
  Fixed the authentication redirect issue where users were being redirected back to the login page after successful login.

  Key changes made:
  1. Enhanced the auth context's login function to better manage loading states
  2. Improved the dashboard page's useEffect to only redirect to login when auth state is definitively 'unauthenticated' AND not loading, preventing premature redirects during state transitions
  3. Updated the cookie settings in the backend to be more explicit about path and domain
  4. Ensured consistency in conditional rendering logic across auth pages

  These changes resolve the race condition where the dashboard would check authentication status before the auth state was properly updated after login.
outcome: |
  Users can now successfully login and remain on the dashboard without being redirected back to the login page.
evaluation: |
  The authentication flow now works correctly with proper state management between login and dashboard navigation.

# Fix Authentication Redirect Issue

## Summary
Fixed the authentication redirect issue where users were being redirected back to the login page after successful login.

## Changes Made

### Frontend Changes
1. **Enhanced auth context's login function** in `frontend/app/contexts/auth-context.tsx`:
   - Added proper loading state management to prevent race conditions
   - Ensured auth state is properly updated after login

2. **Improved dashboard page logic** in `frontend/app/dashboard/page.tsx`:
   - Updated useEffect to only redirect to login when auth state is definitively 'unauthenticated' AND not loading
   - Changed conditional rendering to prevent premature redirects during state transitions
   - Added `!isAuthLoading` check to prevent redirects during authentication checks

### Backend Changes
3. **Updated cookie settings** in `backend/src/api/auth.py`:
   - Added explicit `path="/"` to make cookie available for all paths
   - Added `domain=None` for clarity
   - Maintained consistency in logout endpoint

## Technical Details
The issue was caused by a race condition where:
- After successful login, the user was redirected to the dashboard
- The dashboard checked the auth state, which was still transitioning from 'unknown' to 'authenticated'
- During this transition, the auth state briefly appeared as 'unauthenticated'
- This triggered an immediate redirect back to the login page

The fix ensures proper state synchronization by:
- Waiting for auth state to be definitively 'unauthenticated' before redirecting
- Including loading state in the redirect condition
- Making cookie settings more explicit for better browser compatibility

## Result
Users can now successfully login and remain on the dashboard without being redirected back to the login page.
